YAML

YAML, short for Yet Another Markup Language, is a human-readable data serialization language. It is often used for writing configuration files, but it can also be used for a variety of other purposes, such as storing data in a database or transmitting data between systems.

YAML files are composed of key-value pairs, where the key is a string and the value can be any data type, including strings, numbers, lists, and dictionaries. Keys and values are separated by a colon, and the value is indented to indicate its nesting level.

For example, the following is a YAML file that defines a simple configuration:

name: My configuration

server:
  host: localhost
  port: 8080

database:
  name: my_database
  user: my_user
  password: my_password

This file defines two key-value pairs:

    name is a string that specifies the name of the configuration.
    server is a dictionary that specifies the configuration for the server. The dictionary has two key-value pairs:
        host is a string that specifies the hostname of the server.
        port is an integer that specifies the port number of the server.
    database is a dictionary that specifies the configuration for the database. The dictionary has three key-value pairs:
        name is a string that specifies the name of the database.
        user is a string that specifies the username for the database.
        password is a string that specifies the password for the database.

YAML is a powerful and versatile data serialization language. It is easy to learn and use, and it is supported by a wide range of programming languages and tools.

This repository contains a simple example of a YAML file. The file defines a simple configuration for a web server.
